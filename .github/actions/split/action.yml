name: 'Split'
description: |
  Generates a matrix to split a Maven reactor into a comma separated directory list (E.g. 'dir1,dir2').
  Takes a map (JSON) of group names to glob expressions.
  Glob expressions are expanded to Maven module directories and converted to comma separated lists.
  A 'misc' group is always added to represent everything else by negating all the resolved modules (E.g. '!dir1,!dir2')
inputs:
  groups:
    description: |
      JSON object that describes the groups. E.g.
      {
        "group1": [ "dir1/**", "dir2/**" ],
        "group2": [ "dir3/**" ]
      }
    required: false
    default: 'false'
outputs:
  matrix:
    value: ${{ steps.0.outputs.matrix }}

      E.g.
      includes:
        - group: group1
          modules: dir1,dir2,dir2a
        - group: group2
          modules: dir3,dir3a
        - group: misc
          modules: !dir1,!dir2,!dir2a,!dir3,!dir3a

  using: "composite"
